A child of amusement and luxury.
A comet's current of wine spurted out,
A complete master, but until now
A fickle admirer
Afraid of jealous judgment,
A great charm to the conversation.
A greedy regiment of moneylenders.
Ah, feet, feet! Where are you now?
Ah! For a long time I couldn't forget
Alas, I've wasted a lot of my life
All adorned the office
All clapping. Onegin enters,
All that Eugene yet knew,
All that Paris tastes hungry for,
All these words are not in Russian;
All the things that for whimsy's abundance
All this often gives
All was silent; only the watchmen of the night
Along the sleepy street in rows
Always satisfied with himself,
A magical land! There in the old days,
Amber on the pipes of Tzaregrad,
An affliction, the cause of which
And afterward, in private
And afterward they went away,
And again, devoted to idleness,
And a golden pineapple.
And a sharp, chilled mind.
And at last he sees the light.
And bowed with ease;
And brushes of thirty kinds
And came out of the restroom
And earn my glory:
And excite the smiles of the ladies
And far niente is my law.
And feel the foot in my hand;
and foes and friends came to see the dead man,
And he didn't get into the cheerful workshop.
And he hurries to live and feels in a hurry.
And he pledged his lands.
and her touch makes my faded heart blaze,
And he's very glad that he's changed his old ways
and his jesting with bile and bile,
and his life is monotonous and variegated.
And in the midday swells,
And I see I blame myself before you,
And it is true that in our summer
And Knyazhnin, the friend of liberty;
and labor and agony and joy,
and languishing in his soul's emptiness,
And leaning on the granite,
And longed for glory and praise,
And, looking at the alien light.
And my Eugene has left you.
And, my friends, no one, by God!
And my imagination is again aflame,
And notes are brought to him.
And Onegin went out;
And on the Baltic waves
and Petrarch in his footsteps,
and put a vale at the end of the letter,
And rainbows on the snow:
And reminisce of the past?
And said: “It's time for a change;
and seeing no great loss in it.
And she ran after him,
And so I, careless, have sung.
And soon, soon the trace of the storm
and soothed the anguish of his heart,
And so, thank God,
And spread his hair with his hand,
And sprinkle a sharp word
And St. Petersburg is restless
And Strasbourg's imperishable pie
And suddenly she leaps, and suddenly she flies,
And the boat waved its oars and sailed down the slumbering river:
And the bread-maker, a neat German,
and the captive women of the Salgir's shores.
And the coachmen, around the lights,
and the crooked talk, the clamor, and the swearing!
And the cuckold's majestic cuckold,
And the curtain rises, and makes a noise.
And the dark mind is clear
And the disappointed lorgnette,
and the distant clatter of the droves
and the distrustful old man,
and their harnesses bore them,
And the ladies' thoughtful attire;
and the land of my fathers and my imprisonment?
and the magic bow is obedient,
and the malice of his gloomy epigrams.
and the morning turns to midnight,
and the Muse brought them to life:
And then she'll take her stance, and then she'll take her stride, and then she'll take her stride,
And then they made him sleep;
and then ungodly repeat it,
And the old is delirious with newness.
And the old is out of date,
And the pampering of the senses,
And the rak'ryck is splashing impatiently,
And there he walks in the open air,
And the roar of the horns is drowned out
and the shelf with their dusty family.
And the shelf with their dusty family,
And the water's cheerful glass
and think of the beauty of your nails:
And though he was an ardent lover
(And thus began my romance);
And tomorrow is the same as yesterday.
And took him for walks in the Summer Garden.
And truffles, the luxury of his youth,
And wasted away at last.
And was yawning beforehand,
And we were captivated in the distance
And what I'll name the hero;
And what it lives on, and why
And what we called a dandy.
And with a quick foot she beats her foot.
And with a troop of books he filled his shelf,
and would be glad to bid him farewell.
and, yawning, took up his pen,
And yet they are so pure,
And you young beauties
An enemy of order and a waster,
An honorable citizen of the backstage,
A poem of twenty-five songs.
are as deceitful as their feet.
A renegade of stormy pleasures,
A report from the steward
A reward inestimable,
Are you still the same maidens? Are you not the same maidens?
As a tribute to the land.
A scholarly little fellow, but a pedant:
A secluded study,
As if it were impossible for us
As if they were doing business.
As in the green forest from prison
as the Piet described himself.
At first Onegin's tongue
A time of hope and tender sadness,
Attentive or indifferent!
A useful trade in the world,
A woman with a jug of water is hurrying along,
because I belong to them.
Because I have not sinned for a long time.
Beef-steaks and Strasburger pie.
Beneath the long tablecloth,
Beneath the tempest's veil and the waves,
between Onegin and myself,
Between the cheese of Limburg
Blessed is he that hath combined with it.
Blowing their noses, coughing, coughing, shushing, clapping;
Both of us awaited the malice
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
But at last he fell out of love
But he could not bear it; nothing
But he had grown cold to life.
But I don't want to correct them.
But if my morals had not suffered,
But in what he was a true genius,
“But I've had enough of Didlo.
But I was foolish and foolish in love.
But let us glorify the haughty
But, my God, what a bore
but of ourselves.
But pantaloons, tailcoat, vest,
But read Adam Smith,
But sweeter, in the midst of the night's amusement,
But Terpsichore's foot
But the anecdotes of bygone days
But the clang of the breguet tells them
But their conversation in general
But their talk is unbearable, though it be innocent nonsense;
But the north is bad for me.
But was my Eugene happy,
But, weary with the noise of the ball,
But we were soon divorced
But when I flew to my uncle's village,
But ye blessed husbands,
By the proud lyre of Albion
By the sea on the granite of the cliffs.
By the will of Zeus.
Careless and healthy?
'Cause he couldn't always
Chandra was waiting for him on his watch,
Combs, files of steel,
Come to the shores of the Neva,
confounded me; but I was accustomed
content with his lot,
Corneille's majestic genius;
could be much less crowded
Couldn't understand how the important Grim
Cultivated in the eastern gentleness,
Custom is a despot among men.
Cut in the latest fashion;
Dared to brush his nails before him,
Diana's bosom, Flora's laniths.
does not reflect the face of Diana,
Dotted with carrots all round,
Dressed like a London dandy.
Dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
Each had his own wit and reason:
Eugene, hating litigation,
Eugene immediately went to see him.
Eugene's time came,
Eugene stood pensive,
“Fall down, fall down!” - he shouts;
familiar faces on the dull stage,
Fanciers of the great world!
Far from his Italy.
Fate kept Eugene safe:
Fields! I am devoted to you with my soul.
First Madame followed him,
Flowers, love, country, idleness,
“Flying in the dust on the mail,
Follow your daughters:
Fonvizin, the friend of liberty,
For lumber and lard to us,
For luxury, for luxury, for fashionable relaxation.
For nails and teeth.
For now in his morning dress,
For now of my novel
for sighs, boredom, and deceit.
For the quiet of the countryside:
For the sounds of life he could not spare,
For two days it seemed new to him
For which he ended his brilliant and rebellious age
Free, in the bloom of his best years,
Free, I seek again the union
French cuisine's finest color,
Friends and friendship bore him,
Friends of Ludmila and Ruslan!
From Millionnya suddenly sounded;
From Romulus to the present day
Glittering, half-air,
has already opened his vasisdas.
has ever so tormented my soul!
has taken possession of him;
have I ever wished with such anguish
have not replaced you?
Having served honorably and nobly,
He appeared in the drawing-rooms;
Hear my sorrowful voice:
He bowed, and then to the stage.
He bowed to the men on every side
He caught fame in the meantime;
He could do no better.
He could not distinguish iambic from choric,
He could speak and write;
He could speak French perfectly
He danced the mazurka with ease
He'd be still in bed:
He did not bore him with strict morals,
He didn't want to try it,
He entered. The hall is full of people;
He flew up the marble steps,
He found the court full of favors;
He gave them his inheritance,
He gave three balls every year
He had a happy talent
He had no desire to dig through the chronological dust
He had no higher passion
Heir to all his family.
He kept them in his memory.
He knew Latin enough,
He left you all before him;
He looked at the stage in great distraction
He looked over all the tiers,
He made himself respected
He noticed nothing.
He passed the doorman with an arrow
He points his double lorgnette obliquely.
He read, he read, he read, but to no avail:
Here comes our hero to the hall;
He remembered, though not without sin,
Here's my Onegin at liberty;
Here's our Onegin, a villager,
Here to describe his attire;
Her touch again
He rushed at once to the post-office.
He rushes to Talon: he's sure,
He saw everything: faces, attire
He scolded him a little for mischief
He scorned Homer, Theocritus;
He's glad he's changed to something new.
He's going home to dress.
He shared with the young Semyonova;
He shot himself, thank God,
He sits down with the laudable purpose
He's on his way to bed from the ball:
He spent three hours at least
He's terribly displeased;
He taught him everything in jest,
He turned away and yawned,
He walks between the chairs on his feet,
He wanted to write, but his hard work
He was a pedant in his clothes
He was a profound economist,
He was bored with the noise of the world;
He was caressed by his wicked spouse,
He was shy and bold, and at other times
He was sure that Kaverin was waiting for him there.
He went in, and the cork hit the ceiling,
He who has felt is troubled
He who has lived and thought cannot
His beaver collar.
His brilliant and rebellious age
his comedies a noisy swarm,
His example is a lesson to others;
His father could not understand him
His father lived by debts,
His father was dead then.
His inimitable strangeness
His involuntary devotion to his dreams,
His lazy laziness and his longing laziness
His life is ready for the morning,
How careless in his letters of the heart!
How early could he disturb
How early he was able to hypocritize,
How fervently eloquent,
How he could amaze innocence with jest,
How he could forget himself!
How he knew how to seem new,
How he sarcastically maligned them!
How his eyes shone with obedient tears!
How I envied the waves
How I longed with the waves
How languidly silent he was,
How long have I forgotten for you
How often in the summertime
How quick and tender was his eye,
How the state grows rich,
I am awakened every morning
I ask you to notice my speech:
I befriended him at that time.
I can't tell you;
I could before the learned light
I devote myself to innocent leisure,
I don't catch any flying glory.
I'd still love a ball.
I found it on the table,
I have a word of warning for you.
I have been sadly troubled.
I have finished the first chapter;
I have kept their secret image;
“I have long endured ballets,
I have thought of the form of the plan,
I hold a happy footstep.
I liked his features,
I'll be inspired again,
I'll enjoy it in the wild,
I'll give the fruits of my labors
I'll give them the fruits of my labors:
I'll hear your magic voice!
I'll pay my debt to the censors,
I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon, I'll soon:
I'll yawn silently
I long again, I love again.
I love her, my friend Elvina,
I love the crowdedness, the splendor, and the joy,
I love the frenzy of youth,
I love their feet, but I don't think
I'm always glad to notice the difference
I'm still sad, but there are no tears,
In dreams sometimes cherished
In front of Onegin was gathered
In front of the faded houses
in front of the mirrors
in his paper hat, has more than once
In his soul not despise men;
In Moldavia, in the wilderness of the steppes,
In short, Russian moping
In spring on the grass of the meadows,
in the Academic Dictionary.
in the chronological dust of the earth's history;
in the chronological dust
In the days of mirth and desire
In the golden nights of Italy
In their captivating footsteps
In the last taste of toilette
In the midst of daily pleasures?
In the midst of glorious triumphs,
In the wilderness, the lyrical voice is more resounding,
In this case is not right at all.
invented for amusement,
In winter on the cast iron of the fireplace,
I offer you my services;
I often hear the question:
I once walked there too:
I read little, sleep long,
I remember another time!
I remember them all, and in my dreams
I remember the sea before the storm:
is awakened by the drum.
is more lovely to me.
It attracts by its conventional beauty
It doesn't need gold
It is familiar to me, it is dear to me.
It is holy to the grandsons of Apollo;
It's dark: he sits down in his sledge.
It's not hard for us to shine.
It's not hard to keep up.
It's not the same with us now:
It's possible to be a man of sense
It's time, it's time! - I call out to her;
It's time to leave the dull shore
It would be brave, indeed,
I've dreamed, and my soul
I've dreamt of lovely objects
I've reviewed the whole thing rigorously:
I've wasted many a life!
I wander over a deserted lake,
I wander over the sea, waiting for the weather,
I was angry, he was sullen;
I was born to a life of peace,
I was crazy about balls:
I write, and my heart does not yearn,
(Judges, resolute and strict)
Keep your lorgnette straight!
Latin is out of fashion now:
Let me introduce you:
Let me say, by the way, that all poets.
Like a breezy Venus,
Like a shadow or a faithful wife.
Like Byron, the proud poet,
Like Child-Harold, sullen and languid.
Like him, retired from the world,
Like the English splendor,
Like women, he left the books,
Like your light footprints in the meadows.
Lovely, sweet friends!
Love passed, the Muse appeared,
Love's dreamy friend.
Love's maddening anxiety
madman, will you forget them?
may talk of Seay and Bentham,
Monsieur l'Abbé, a poor Frenchman,
Monsieur was banished from the court.
More glasses, thirsty begging
My goddesses! What are you? Where are you?
My happiest days?
My uncle was an honest man,
My youthful days were spent there.
Near the unfinished verses,
Newborn creation,
no cards, no balls, no poems.
No gossip of light, no boston,
No: his senses were soon cold in him;
No matter how hard we tried, he could not tell the difference.
No, never did a passion of passion
No, never in the fervent days
nor a sweet look, nor an immodest sigh,
nor the songs they inspire:
Nothing came out of his pen,
Nothing touched him,
Now from you, my friends,
No woman's feet, no woman's head;
O Brenta! No, I'll see you,
Of blind Fortune and men
Of charming actresses,
of his old uncle's death.
Of innocent years of prejudice
of intricate calumny,
Of ladies and fashionable geezers.
of magic sounds, feelings and thoughts;
Of men I don't judge,
Of my boiling youth
of people's tears and applause
“of the stormy waves
of the unpleasant elements,
Onegin flew to the theater,
Onegin goes to the boulevard
Onegin locked himself up at home,
Onegin, my good friend,
Onegin was, in the opinion of many.
Onegin was ready with me
Only a boat, waving its oars,
On St. Petersburg's sidewalk,
On the boxes of the ladies he doesn't know;
On the free crossroads of the sea
On the mirrored parquet of the hall,
On the snow of the north
On the stage, they gallop and clamor;
On the very morning of our days.
Or any publisher
Or else. or else, God forbid!
Or foreseeing from afar
Or shall my gloomy eye find no familiar faces
Or shone, my reader;
or the peaches full of languor;
or the roses of flaming palms,
Or to give a letter.
Outside and inside
O ye honorable spouses!
Perfume in cut crystal;
Plants, waters, forests, lands
Porcelain and bronze on the table,
Pour out a cheerful light
Preparing himself for the sake of money,
Prince Vyazemsky.
Pursue love, and then suddenly
Ready to clap the entrechat,
Remembering old loves,
Remembering the romances of former years,
rings his dinner bell.
Rises in a column of blue smoke,
Rousseau (in passing)
Sailing in a mysterious gondola;
Satire's bold lord,
Sensitive, carefree again,
Shadows walk through the solid windows,
Shall I depict in a faithful picture
She flies like fluff from the lips of Aeolus;
She, prophesying to my eye
Sighing and thinking to yourself:
Sleep on their coats at the door;
Sleeps peacefully in the shade of the blissful.
So discreet, so precise,
So full of piety,
So stately, so clever,
So that the child should not be tormented,
So, to tell you the truth,
So unapproachable to men.
So unapproachable to men,
So we were carried away by a dream
Spent my happiest days in idleness, in the shadows.
Standing there is Istomina,
Straight scissors, crooked scissors,
Suddenly he received a report
surrounded by a crowd of nymphs,
That a mocking reader
That a new ballet has begun.
That he was clever and very sweet.
that his uncle was dead in his bed
That I have painted my portrait,
That is, he could judge how a state
that London trades in the lavish trade.
That my poor syllable, as it is.
That remorse gnaws at him.
that should have been found long ago,
That's what the young hustler thought,
That's why I'm writing this,
That the same boredom was in the village,
The Adriatic waves,
The ashes that are burnt out will not flare up,
The beauties were not long
The cabman goes to the stock exchange,
The cavalier's spurs are clattering;
The child was sharp but sweet.
The conditions of light, and the burden of light,
The coolness of the dusky oak-tree,
The crowd is busy with the mazurka;
The dead man's friends and foes
The dead man was buried.
The defender of liberty and right
The desires of the willful swarm.
The double lanterns of the carriage
The eloquent madman.
The feet of the ladies are flying;
The fiery gazes of the ladies are flying,
The frosty dust is silvery
The ghost of days gone by
The goddess goes to the masquerade.
The grove, the hill, and the field did not occupy him;
The happiness of my youth is gone.
The hearts of the ladies of record!
The heat of the heart was gone in both of us;
The highest tone is rather dull;
The horn and the song
The horses are still chillin' and beating,
The hotness of rhyme: he hath doubled the sacred delirium
The hunters of the funeral.
The jealous whispers of fashionable wives.
The language of Petrarch and love.
The lanterns are shining everywhere;
The life of both of us was a torment;
The lonely fields,
The luxurious touch of the soft carpets.
The maiden of the mountains, my ideal,
The merchant rises, the peddler comes,
The more lively the creative dreams.
The morning snow is crunching beneath her.
The music was tired;
Then he saw clearly
The night sky above the Neva,
Then I'll begin to write
Then Monsieur took her place.
The noise of the morning is pleasant.
The parterre and the seats are all abuzz;
The pen, forgetting itself, does not draw,
The philosopher's office at eighteen.
The priests and guests ate and drank,
The profiles of heads glimmering
There are many contradictions,
“There are still cupids, devils, snakes.
There Diderot was crowned with glory,
There'll be a ball, there'll be a children's party.
There our Katenin resurrected
There Ozerov's tribute was unwillingly paid
There's a different kind of burden on everyone;
There's boredom, there's deceit, there's nonsense;
There's conscience, there's no sense;
There's no better place for confessions
There's noise and crowding all around;
There's no more charms for him.
There the prickly Shakhovskoy brought out
There, there, under the shadow of the backstage
The roast-beef was bloody before him,
The sacred delirium of poetry,
The second Chadaev, my Eugene,
The sentries of the night;
The serpent of remembrance,
The shutters are open; the trumpet smoke
The sound of a quiet brook;
The spectator of mirth is indifferent,
The splendid house gleams;
The subject of his habitual thoughts;
the sword and the sword and the lead.
The theater is full; the boxes are shining;
The theater's evil legislator,
The third day the grove, the hill, and the field
The tune of Torquat's octaves!
The well-dweller is carried from his sleep,
The winds of the ship's breeze.
The words and eyes of these enchantresses
They are not worthy of passion,
They're still stomping
They scold their masters and beat their hands:
They stir my heart.
though I had looked in the old days
Though it may be that some lady
Though there be no streets, no palaces,
Three houses are calling for a party:
Three pairs of slender women's legs.
Till a watchful burgher
“Tired footmen
To adjust his pillows,
To amuse a half-dead man,
To amuse with pleasant flattery,
To appropriate to himself the mind of others;
To be heard.
To be proud and obedient,
To bring him his medicine sadly,
To catch a moment's delight,
To conceal hope, to be jealous,
To conquer with wit and passion,
To describe my own business:
“To disbelieve, to make you believe,
To douse the hot fat of the cutlets,
To expect involuntary caresses,
To frighten with despair,
To get a secret rendezvous.
To give her lessons in silence!
To hear the first sound of the heart,

To keep silence in an important dispute.

To lie lovingly at her feet!

To plead and demand confession,

To sigh for gloomy Russia,
To sit with a sick man day and night,
To smear Phaedra, Cleopatra,
To summon Moina,

To touch her feet with my lips!

Was he ever so happy in the midst of feasts
Was it not so in my former years

We all learned a little
Wearing a broad bolivar,
We both knew the game of passion:
We'd better hurry to the ball,
We silently reveled in it!
We've all learned a little something and a little something,
We were divorced for a long time.
What he knew better than all the sciences,
What? Invitations? Indeed,
What low treachery
What more do you want? The world has decided
What nets he prepared for them!
What occupied all the day long
What of my Onegin? Half asleep
What was for him of all his days
When, and where, in what desert,
When he got sick in a funny way,
When he had a headache
When he read the sad message,
When he wanted to destroy
When he wanted to destroy his rivals,
When I here compare my features,
When it has a simple product.
When the night sky above Nevoya
When the rebellious youth
When, wearing a man's attire,
When will I start my free run?
“When will the devil take you?”
Where are the flowers of spring?
Where everyone, breathing freely,
Where I buried my heart.
Where I have suffered, where I have loved,
Where my Onegin has already ridden.
Where my Onegin has gone in a coach.

Where will my mischief-maker go?

Whose eye, with sweet caresses.
Whose glance, stirring inspiration,

Why argue fruitlessly with the age?
Will I hear your choruses again?
Will I see the Russian Terpsichore
Will the hour of my freedom come?
